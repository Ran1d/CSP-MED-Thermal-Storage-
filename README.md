# CSP-MED-Thermal-Storage-

·  Developed a dynamic-thermodynamic model for an 8-Effect Forward Feed MED plant integrated with a Parabolic Trough Solar Collector (PTSC) field and a 50,000 kWh Thermal Energy Storage (TES) unit.

·  Engineered to deliver a stable thermal desalination demand of 3.01 MW.

·  Achieved high fidelity with less than 1.2% error across all primary performance metrics (GOR, Thermal Load, Specific Area).

 The TES unit extends daily plant operation from 12 hours to 15.6 hours, maximizing stable distillate production to 84,317.17 kg/day.

·  Thermal storage is a feasible and effective solution for ensuring high productivity and resource utilization in large-scale renewable desalination projects.
