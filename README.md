# CSP-MED-Thermal-Storage-
The project involves the comprehensive dynamic and thermodynamic modeling of an 8-Effect Forward Feed Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) plant integrated with a Parabolic Trough Solar Collector (PTSC) field and a 50,000 \text{ kWh} Thermal Energy Storage (TES) unit. The system was engineered to deliver a stable thermal demand of \mathbf{3.01 \text{ MW}} for desalination.  The model's validation demonstrated extremely high fidelity, achieving less than a 1.2\% error across all primary design metrics (GOR, Thermal Load, and Specific Area) compared to established literature benchmarks. 
The subsequent dynamic simulation successfully optimized the system's operation, proving that the 50,000 \text{ kWh} TES unit is capable of extending the plant's operational time from approximately 12 hours of peak sunlight to 15.6 \text{ hours} per day, resulting in a maximized stable daily distillate production of \mathbf{84,317.17 \text{ kg/day}}. This confirms the feasibility of using thermal storage to ensure high productivity and resource utilization in large-scale renewable desalination projects.
